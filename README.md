# TypeScript

**TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.**

TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor.

TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.js or Deno and in your apps.

TypeScript understands JavaScript and uses type inference to give you great tooling without additional code.

## Design Patterns

**Design patterns are used to represent some of the best practices adapted by experienced object-oriented software developers. A design pattern systematically names, motivates, and explains a general design that addresses a recurring design problem in object-oriented systems. It describes the problem, the solution, when to apply the solution, and its consequences.**
